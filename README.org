I am majoring in Math/CompSci :P. My interest lies on the mathematical properties of computation and the mechanized formalization.

In particular, I am exploring following fields:
- Mathematical Logic (Set Theory, Model Theory, Proof Theory, and Type theory)
- Formal Method (Abstract Interpretation and Interactive Proof Assitant)
- System Security (Fuzzing and Exploitations)

Seeking for a position of industrial intern, research assistant, or Ph.D degree.
